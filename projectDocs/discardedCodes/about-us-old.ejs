      <h5 class="fw-bold">Where Love Transcends Suffering</h5>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em">
      Snehaanchal Palliative Care Centre is a registered charitable trust working hand-in-hand with cancer sufferers and
      their families, providing all possible support in their hour of need. Our team of doctors, nurses, psychologists,
      counselors, and volunteers collectively offer holistic care to the distressed patients and their families, until
      and
      even after bereavement. As the name suggests, the team provides a loving, comforting and supportive cover of care.
      Hence the name <strong>'Snehaanchal'</strong>. Set up at Nagpur in technical co-operation with Rashtrasant Tukdoji
      Regional Cancer Hospital in 2006, it has been serving cancer patients and their families since then. All services
      here,
      including medicines for symptomatic relief, stay &amp; food, etc., are provided free of charge and irrespective of
      caste, creed, religion, gender or nationality.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em">
      Cancer, as we all know, is a dreadful disease. Unless it is detected very early and appropriately treated,
      prognosis is
      not very bright in most cases. Treatment is long, expensive and is usually accompanied by host of distressing
      symptoms,
      physical, psychosocial, emotional and spiritual as well. The entire family, as a unit, is drained financially and
      emotionally. If the patient is poor or young in age, problems get further compounded. The journey from detection
      of the
      disease, through its treatment, remission, re-occurrence, re-treatment, end-of-life stage and finally death…all of
      it
      is full of physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual struggles.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em">
      <strong>Palliative Care</strong><br />
      Palliative care is a multi-disciplinary team approach, envisaging medicine, physiotherapy, psychology, sociology &
      spiritual care, which aims at reducing physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual pain of patients and their
      family members. It is a symptomatic care wherein all distressing symptoms, physical and non-physical, are
      addressed.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em">
      <strong>Hospice Care</strong><br />
      A Hospice literally means a homelike facility to provide supportive palliative care to advanced stage cancer
      patients
      when their disease is unresponsive to curative treatment. In this stage severe distressing symptoms like pain,
      nausea,
      bleeding etc. can manifest. It may not be always possible to address all such symptoms at home. Under such a
      situation,
      Hospice Care is recommended. Such care is based on the ethos of care and not cure, for cure may have a limit but
      not
      care.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em">
      <strong>Home Care</strong><br />
      Home Care Often patients do not wish to get admitted for in-patient care at the hospice. However, they continue to
      suffer at home for want of proper palliative care/treatment. Many of them are too poor to go to a GP for
      resolution of
      their symptoms. And even if they do go, a GP being hardly trained for palliative care, they do not get appropriate
      care/treatment. Snehaanchal has a Home Care team consisting of a trained Nurse, Nursing Aid and a Counsellor. The
      team
      is able to visit 5 – 6 homes per day. Nursing care is provided at home by the Nurse and medicines are advised
      under
      guidance from Doctor at hospice. The counsellor provides psychosocial & emotional support to patients & their
      family.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em">
      <strong>Subsidised medicines</strong><br />

      All medicines required for symptomatic treatment and pain management of in patients are provided free of cost at
      Snehaanchal Palliative Care Centre. Morphine is a wonder drug in acute pain management. Morphine is administered
      and
      dispensed free of cost to OPD and in patients. Snehaanchal goes a step forward in sourcing chemo drugs for cancer
      patients at reasonable cost as additional service.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em">
      Some of life’s most testing times arrive with a serious illness, such as Cancer. Not only does it inflict endless
      suffering on the patient, but also leave its mark on the entire family. As pain, fear, and restlessness begin to
      consume the patient, helplessness takes its toll on the loved ones too. Snehaanchal has been established in
      technical
      cooperation with Rashtra Sant Tukdoji Cancer Hospital & Research Center to support patients and their families
      through
      this unbearable chain of physical, psychological and emotional vulnerability. It is a ray of light when the day
      refuses
      to rise and the night goes on. It is where love transcends suffering, care brings joy, and togetherness evokes a
      sense
      of healing. OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING MEDICINES, FOOD & STAY ARE FREE OF COST.

      <strong>Advocacy and Awareness</strong><br />
      Snehaanchal envisions that nobody must live with or die in pain of any sort; physical, psychosocial or emotional.
      Though cure may not be always possible, care can be endless. To ensure this vision is materialized, creating
      awareness
      about Palliative Care and to make it available and accessible to all, especially the poor, is paramount.
      <br />
      Our Awareness & Advocacy team regularly undertakes the following initiatives.

      #1 What is the nature of the service/care provided by a hospice?
    </a>
    <div class="collapse" id="FAQ1">
      <div class="card card-body">
        The first goal is to relieve the patient of pain and any distressing symptoms. Once this is achieved, we help
        them
        and their family members to come to terms with the disease and its prognosis. The aim is to gradually make them
        accept the final eventuality so that they are at peace with themselves, their families, and their God.

      #2 What services are not provided by the hospice?
    </a>
    <div class="collapse" id="FAQ2">
      <div class="card card-body">
        Treatment methods of cancer, like surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, etc., are not provided at the
        hospice.
        Further, complementary medicine, proton therapy, clinical trials, and cutting-edge technologies are also not
        provided
        in a hospice.No life-extending measures, like a ventilator, blood transfusion, and oxygen are provided. The
        philosophy of end-life-care envisages that no life-limiting or life-extending measures will be deployed.

      #3 What are opiates and what is morphine? Is there a possibility of getting addicted to morphine?
    </a>
    <div class="collapse" id="FAQ3">
      <div class="card card-body">
        Opiates, like Morphine, are the best drugs for controlling severe pain. Opiates help the patient to get relief
        from
        severe pain when all the other painkillers prove ineffective. Opiates like Morphine do not cause addiction when
        used
        to relieve cancer pain. In fact, if the pain is substantially reduced and the patient feels fine, it may not be
        necessary to continue with morphine as other painkillers may suffice.

        Other misconceptions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            That large doses of morphine are administered to patients:The patient is put on morphine only when other
            painkillers prove ineffective. Doses are set by doctors according to the level of pain experienced by the
            patient
            and as per WHO guidelines for pain management. It is administered after close observation and careful
            assessment
            of the patient’s pain. Not less, not more.
          </li>
          <li>
            That patients become drowsy:It is not true in every case. Most patients are very alert and active all the
            time
            after consuming opiates.
