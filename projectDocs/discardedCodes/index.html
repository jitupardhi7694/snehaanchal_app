   <span style="font-size: 20px"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif">Cancer, as we all know, is a dreadful
         disease. Unless it is detected very early and appropriately treated,
         prognosis is not very bright in most cases. Treatment is long, expensive and is usually accompanied by host of
         distressing symptoms, physical, psychosocial, emotional and spiritual as well. The entire family, as a unit, is
         drained financially and emotionally. If the patient is poor or young in age, problems get further compounded.
         The journey from detection of the disease, through its treatment, remission, re-occurrence, re-treatment,
         end-of-life stage and finally death&hellip;all of it is full of physical, psychological, emotional and
         spiritual struggles.</span></span><br />
   &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
   <span style="font-size: 20px"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><strong>Palliative Care</strong><br />
         Palliative care is a multi-disciplinary team approach, envisaging medicine, physiotherapy, psychology,
         sociology &amp; spiritual care, which aims at reducing physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual pain of
         patients and their family members. It is a symptomatic care wherein all distressing symptoms, physical and
         non-physical, are addressed.</span></span><br />
   &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
   <span style="font-size: 20px"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><strong>Hospice Care</strong><br />
         A Hospice literally means a homelike facility to provide supportive palliative care to advanced stage cancer
         patients when their disease is unresponsive to curative treatment. In this stage severe distressing symptoms
         like pain, nausea, bleeding etc. can manifest. It may not be always possible to address all such symptoms at
         home. Under such a situation, Hospice Care is recommended. Such care is based on the ethos of care and not
         cure, for cure may have a limit but not care.</span></span><br />
   &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
   <span style="font-size: 20px"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><strong>Home Care</strong><br />
         Often patients do not wish to get admitted for in-patient care at the hospice. However, they continue to suffer
         at home for want of proper palliative care/treatment. Many of them are too poor to go to a GP for resolution of
         their symptoms. And even if they do go, a GP being hardly trained for palliative care, they do not get
         appropriate care/treatment.<br />
         Snehaanchal has a Home Care team consisting of a trained Nurse, Nursing Aid and a Counsellor. The team is able
         to visit 5 &ndash; 6 homes per day. Nursing care is provided at home by the Nurse and medicines are advised
         under guidance from Doctor at hospice. The counsellor provides psychosocial &amp; emotional support to patients
         &amp; their family.<br />
         To discharge their social responsibilities, corporates can consider joining hands with Snehaanchal to provide
         Palliative Care to the critically ill and make a positive difference in their lives. Funding for Palliative
         Care is covered under clause (v) of Schedule VII of Companies Act 2013.</span></span>

<h1>general faq</h1>
<h5>What is the nature of the service/care provided by a hospice?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">The first goal is to relieve the patient of pain and any
         distressing symptoms. Once this is achieved, we help
         them and their family members to come to terms with the disease and its prognosis. The aim is to gradually make
         them accept the final eventuality so that they are at peace with themselves, their families, and their
         God.</span></span>
</p>
<h5>What services are not provided by the hospice?</h5>
<p>
   <span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: 18px">Treatment methods of cancer, like surgery, chemotherapy,
         radiation therapy, etc., are not provided at the
         hospice. Further, complementary medicine, proton therapy, clinical trials, and cutting-edge technologies are
         also not provided in a hospice.No life-extending measures, like a ventilator, blood transfusion, and oxygen are
         provided. The philosophy of end-life-care envisages that no life-limiting or life-extending measures will be
         deployed.</span></span>
</p>
<h5>What are opiates and what is morphine? Is there a possibility of getting addicted to morphine?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">Opiates, like Morphine, are the best drugs for controlling
         severe pain. Opiates help the patient to get relief
         from severe pain when all the other painkillers prove ineffective. Opiates like Morphine do not cause addiction
         when used to relieve cancer pain. In fact, if the pain is substantially reduced and the patient feels fine, it
         may not be necessary to continue with morphine as other painkillers may suffice.</span></span>
</p>
<h5>What are the other misconceptions about opiates and morphine?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: 18px">Other misconceptions:</span></span>
</p>

<ul>
   <li style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 18px"><em><span style="color: black">That large doses of morphine are administered to
               patients:</span></em><span style="color: black">The patient is put on morphine only when other
            painkillers prove ineffective. Doses are set by doctors
            according to the level of pain experienced by the patient and as per WHO guidelines for pain management. It
            is administered after close observation and careful assessment of the patient&rsquo;s pain. Not less, not
            more.</span></span>
   </li>
   <li style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 18px"><em><span style="color: black">That patients become drowsy:</span></em><span
            style="color: black">It is not true in every case. Most patients are very alert and active all the time
            after consuming
            opiates.</span></span>
   </li>
</ul>
<h5>What charges are payable for Snehaanchal Hospice service?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">Snehaanchal does not charge any money from the patient. All
         services provided by it, including medicines,
         food, stay, care, etc., are completely free. Food (free of charge) is presently provided to patients, whereas
         for the caregivers, food is currently provided by voluntary groups of people. Stay is free of charge for family
         members.</span></span>
</p>
<h5>What are the criteria of admission to the hospice? When is the best time to get admitted to a hospice?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">The criteria are:</span></span>
</p>

<ul>
   <li style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">The patient must be a cancer sufferer facing severe
            distressing physical, psychosocial &amp; emotional
            symptoms.</span></span>
   </li>
   <li style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">Sometimes a patient can be admitted for short durations
            to provide respite to the family members or
            caregivers.
         </span></span>
   </li>
</ul>
<h5>Who provides medical nursing care in a hospice? Who provides psychosocial counseling and support?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">Doctors who are especially trained and experienced in

         care.A trained and experienced psychologist or social worker provides psychosocial counseling.</span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<h5>What kind of nutrition is provided in a hospice?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">Hygienically prepared, nutritious&amp; balanced diet is
         provided to the patients. Family members do not need
         to bring food for the patients. Patients can also req for a special food of their liking. However, only
         vegetarian food is provided.</span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">Yes, the relatives are allowed to stay with the patients.
         There is also a dormitory for the relatives of
         outstation patients. Food is also provided to the relatives by voluntary groups of people.</span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Once admitted, can a person take discharge from the hospice & go home?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">Yes, the patient is always free to go back to their home
         whenever they feel like it. If the family members are
         willing to take the patient home, the patient is allowed to go back home.</span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">Before sending the patient home, the caregivers at hospice
         ensure that family members are fully trained to do
         wound-dressing, feeding, managing catheter, etc., so that they face no difficulty on this count while at
         home.</span></span>
</p>
<h5>Can a discharged patient seek re-admission to the hospice?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">Yes, hospice is more like a home for a patient and if the
         distressing symptoms re-appear, the patient is
         always welcomed back.</span></span>
</p>
<h5>What is done in the event of death of a person admitted to the hospice?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">The relatives are quickly informed. Also the deceased is
         given a bath and laid in the room where prayer is
         undertaken for his or her soul and then handed over to the family.</span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<h5>When is the right time to start Home Care?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify">
   <span style="font-size: 18px"><span style="color: black">Palliative care can run complementary to curative
         treatment.&nbsp; If the patient, while on curative treatment
         or otherwise, is suffering from symptoms like pain, vomiting, nausea, bleeding or has a fungating tumor needing
         regular dressing, then it is advisable to ask for a Home Palliative Care. It must also be sought when the
         patient is suffering from severe anxiety and depression arising because of the disease, affecting both him/her
         and his/her family.</span></span>
</p>
<h5>Does Snehaanchal Home team provide treatment/cure to the patient with cancer?</h5>

   Some of life’s most testing times arrive with a serious illness, such as Cancer. Not only does it inflict endless
   suffering on the patient, but also leave its mark on the entire family. As pain, fear, and restlessness begin to
   consume the patient, helplessness takes its toll on the loved ones too.

   Cancer Hospital & Research Center to support patients and their families through this unbearable chain of physical,
   psychological and emotional vulnerability. It is a ray of light when the day refuses to rise and the night goes on.
   It is where love transcends suffering, care brings joy, and togetherness evokes a sense of healing.<br />
